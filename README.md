It's main application is for web development

### Notice from the creator
At this time I don't really have the knowledge nor the availability to be working on this project, therefor I ask that anyone who's willing to give me a hand in the creation of it to create pull requests, forks etc and I'll be happy to work with you in the spare minutes I have available to me.

I sincerely apologise on my behalf that I can't create it myself, however I would like to let other people colaborate with me in making it and it would be an amazing learning experience to everyone, not only in how Brackets extensions are made and how Discord Rich Presence works, but also just being able to work together with people that I have never met before in the creation of something that will be used by quite possibly a lot of people.

If you would like to get in touch with me in helping out with the creation of the extension, then please contact me on Discord: LatencyPain#7893.
