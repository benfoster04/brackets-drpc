# brackets-drpc - Brackets Discord Rich Presence
A brackets extension that allows for Discord Rich Presence

Brackets is an open-source code editor made by Adobe.
It's main application is for web development

### Notice from the creator
Due to the recent news from Adobe suspending support for Brackets, this project has concluded. The result is that getting RPC between Brackets and Discord would be a pain in the backside anyways due to the sheer nature of how Brackets works internally. This project has been archived. Thank you as well for the interest in the project from the few of you who wanted to help make it possible.
